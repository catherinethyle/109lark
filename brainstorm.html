    <p>net art idea???? maybe a kind of journal entry thing where the text dissepears and have images come up eery so often like a invisable diary but you kinda are able to see everything more as you scroll maybe the scroll is automated and the story kind of reveals itself? i feel like a scap booky vibe would be really cool for this idea and i could actually use a journal entry or base it off text of a book i like and kind of have annotations to it and images and memories that come to mind when i'm reading it (it would be on earth we are briefly gorgeous) i think that would be really nice</p>

    <p>topics that i'm interest in pursuing are the ones i''ve listed above. i don't think i can chose between my own journal entries or if i want to d othe annotated book one, i think both are really intteresting, just haveto relook at the assignement parameters</p>
