                            You said that once, with your back to me,the way a god would say it. But if you were a god
                            you would see them. You would look down at this grove of pines, the fresh tips flared lucent
                            at each treetop, tender-damp in their late autumn flush. You would look past the branches,
                            past the rusted light splintered through the brambles, the needles falling, one by one, as
                            you lay your god eyes on them. You'd trace the needles as they hurdled themselves past the
                            lowest bough, toward the cooling forest floor, to land on the two boys lying side by side,
                            the blood already dry on their cheeks.

                        Although it covers both their faces, the blood belongs to the tall boy, the one with ees the
                        dark grey of a river beneath somebody's shadow. What's left of November seeps through their
                        jeans, their thin knit sweaters. If you were god, you'd notice that they're staring at you.
                        They're clapping and singing<br>

                        they'd listen to ealier in the afternoon on the tall boy's stereo. It was his old man's favorite
                        song, the tall boy had said. And so now their heads sway side to side as their teeth glow
                        beneath the notes, and the caked blood crumbles from their jaws, flecking their pale throats as
                        the song leaves them in fistfuls of smoke.<br>

                        The cut under the tall boy's eye has reopened from his singing, and a black-red line now runs
                        down from his left ear, curing at hisneck and vanishing in the ground. The small boy glances at
                        his friends, the terrible bulb of an eye, and tries to forget. If you were a god you would tell

                        down like the hands of smashed watches.

                        him. He'd feel it floating on the right side of his chest, just between the ribs. The bullet was
                        always here, the boy thinks, older even than himself-and his bones, tendons, and veins had
                        merely wrapped around the metal shard, sealing it inside him.<br>

                        his sweater. He feels for the protrusion but,as usual, finds nothing. It's receding, he thinks.
                        It wants to stay inside me. It is nothing without me.<br>

                        Evening had turned the glass into a mirror and you couldn't see him there, only the lines scored
                        across your cheek and brow, a face someow ravaged by stillness. The boy, he watchs his mother
                        watching nothing, his entire self inside the phantom oval of her face, invisible.

                        Sometimes, when I'm careless, I tink survival is easy: you just keep moving forward with what you have, or what's left of what you were given, until something changes-or you realize, at last, that you can change without disappearing, that all you had to do was wait until the storm passes you over and you find that-yes- your name is still attached to a living thing.

                        A few months before our talk at Dunkin' Donuts, a fourteen-year-old boy in rural Vietnam had acid thrown in his face after he slipped a love letter into another boy's locker. Last summer, twenty-eight-year-old Florida native Omar Mateen walked into an Orlando nightclub, riased his automatic rifle, and opened fire. Forty-nine people were killed. It was a gay nightclub and the boys, because that's who they were-sons, teenagers- looked like me: a colored thing born of one mother, rummaging the dark, each other, for happiness.

                        The weight of the average placenta is roughly one and a half pounds. A disposable organ where nutrients, hormones, and waste are passed between mother and fetus. In this way, thee placenta is a kind of language-perhaps our first one, our true mother tounge. At four or five months, my brother's placent was already fully developed. You two were speaking-in blood utterances.

                        In college a professor once insisted, during a digression from aa lecture on <i>Othello</i>, that, to him, gay men are inherently narcissistic, and that overt narcissism might even be a sign of homosexuality in men who have no yet accepted their "tendencies." Even as I fumed in my seat, the tought wouldn't stop burrowing into me. Could it be that, all those years ago, I had followed Gramoz into the schoolyard simply because he was a boy, and therefore a mirror or myself?

                        That the haunted boy we move in has not yet been annihilated, scraped out. To see yourself still <i>yourself</i> is refuge men who have not been denied cannot know.

                        I read that beauty has historically demanded replication. We make more of anything we find aesthetically pleasing, whether it's a vase, a painting, a chalice, a poem. We reproduce it in order to keep it, extend it through space and time. To gaze at what pleases-a fresco, a peach-red mountain range, a boy, the mole on his jaw-is in itself, replication- the image prolonged in the eye, making more of it, making it last. Staring into the mirror, I replicate myself into a future where I might not exist. And yes, it was not pizza bagelss, all those years ago, that I wanted from Gramoz, but replication. Because his offering extended me into something worthy of generosity, and therefore seen. It was that very moreness that I wanted o prolong, to return to.
